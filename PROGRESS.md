# Trends Progress Report

## Current Status
- Overall status: Authentication + customer account (Phase 6) is
  implemented **and verified** this session — full network access was
  available. `npm install`, a fresh migration for 3 new tables,
  `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, and a real end-to-end HTTP walkthrough
  against a running production server (`npm run start`) all actually
  ran: register→login→session→protected-route→logout, wrong-password
  rejection, duplicate-mobile rejection, password-reset token lifecycle,
  and cross-user address-ownership enforcement were all exercised for
  real, not just written and assumed correct. One real bug was found and
  fixed during verification — see "Current Phase" below.
- Current phase: none in progress — PHASE 6 is COMPLETE.
- Last completed phase: PHASE 6 — Authentication + customer account
- Next phase: PHASE 7 — Wishlist + cart
- Date: 2026-09-12

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Repository audit + implementation plan
Prototype structure, design tokens, missing assets, and architecture
decisions were audited. See git history for the full write-up if needed;
nothing here changed this session.

### Phase 1 — Next.js foundation + design system shell
Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 foundation, design tokens
ported verbatim from the prototype, Header/Footer shell, Button/Container
primitives. Verified passing at the time.

### Phase 2 — Homepage visual migration (verified COMPLETE)
Rebuilt every homepage section from `reference/prototype.html` as React
components (hero carousel, category nav, featured products, promo
banners, new arrivals, benefits strip, search overlay, cart drawer).
Verified in a prior session (see git history for the full write-up).

### Phase 3 — Database + catalog domain (COMPLETE)
PostgreSQL + Drizzle catalog schema (`categories`, `products`,
`product_variants`, `product_images`), migrations, seed data, repository
layer. Verified in a prior session (see git history for the full
write-up).

### Phase 4 — Storefront catalog pages (COMPLETE)
Category pages, product listing/detail, variant selection, breadcrumbs,
related products, pagination/sorting/filters. Verified in a prior session.

### Phase 5 — Search + SEO foundations (COMPLETE)
Real PostgreSQL-backed search, URL-driven filters, metadata/canonical/OG,
sitemap/robots, `Product` JSON-LD. Verified in a prior session (see git
history for the full write-up, including known follow-ups: search
relevance is a simple `ILIKE`, not full-text; category OG images;
`Product` JSON-LD's Toman-under-`IRR` currency mismatch — all still
outstanding, unrelated to Phase 6).

### Phase 6 — Authentication + customer account (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** real customer identity — registration, login, logout, secure
sessions, password reset, Iranian mobile normalization, an account
profile, and an address book — with server-side ownership checks, not
just hidden UI.

**Auth solution chosen:** **NextAuth v5 (`next-auth@beta`, currently
`5.0.0-beta.32`) — Credentials provider, `session.strategy: "jwt"`, no
database adapter.** Rationale, fully documented in
`src/lib/auth/config.ts`'s header comment: a Credentials-only flow with
JWT sessions needs no adapter (adapters model OAuth-shaped identity,
a poor fit for mobile+password), and JWT-in-an-HttpOnly-cookie is what
NextAuth manages itself — the token never touches client JS or
`localStorage`, satisfying rule A.12/G. Verified this session (see
"Tests/checks") that failed logins set no session cookie, successful
logins set `authjs.session-token` as `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`, and
`/api/auth/signout` actually clears it.
`next-auth@beta`'s own `peerDependencies` explicitly list `next: '...
|| ^16.0.0'` and `react: '... || ^19.0.0'` — confirmed compatible with
this project's Next 16.3.4/React 19 before installing, not assumed.

Password hashing: `bcryptjs` (pure JS, no native build step) via a thin
wrapper in `src/domains/auth/password.ts`, 12 salt rounds.

**New dependencies added** (`package.json`): `next-auth@beta`,
`bcryptjs`, `zod`. (`@types/bcryptjs` was attempted but `bcryptjs@3.x`
ships its own types, so nothing extra was actually needed there.)

**New schema** (`src/lib/db/schema/`, migration
`drizzle/migrations/0001_perpetual_marten_broadcloak.sql`, applied and
verified against a real local Postgres):
- `users.ts`: `mobile` (canonical `+98XXXXXXXXXX`, unique) is the login
  identifier, not email, per TRENDS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §3/§5. `email`
  optional (unique when present). `role` is a Postgres enum
  (`customer`/`staff`/`admin`) per §7's "prefer explicit roles over one
  boolean `isAdmin`" — Phase 11 (admin) will read this, nothing enforces
  it yet since there's no admin area to protect. `mobileVerified`
  (boolean, defaults `false`) exists for a future real OTP/SMS provider
  to set — nothing sets it `true` yet since none is configured (rule
  A.17). `passwordHash` never leaves this file's `toPublicUser()`
  helper's output.
- `addresses.ts`: Iranian address book fields exactly per §5 (recipient
  name/mobile, province, city, address line, postal code, optional
  plaque/unit + delivery notes). Documented in-file as the *current*
  address book, not what an order snapshots — Phase 8's `orders` table
  will copy fields at purchase time rather than FK-ing to a row here,
  since this table's rows can be edited/deleted after an order ships.
- `password-reset-tokens.ts`: only a SHA-256 hash of the raw token is
  stored (same "never store the actual secret" principle as
  `passwordHash`), 30-minute TTL, single-use via nullable `usedAt`.

**New domain code:**
- `src/lib/utils/phone.ts` — Iranian mobile normalization to canonical
  `+98XXXXXXXXXX`, accepting `09...`/`9...`/`+98...`/`0098...` and
  Persian/Arabic-Indic digits. Exports `toAsciiDigits` too, reused by the
  postal-code validator.
- `src/lib/validation/auth.ts` — Zod schemas for every auth/address
  mutation (register/login/forgot-password/reset-password/address),
  including a `z.preprocess` step that normalizes mobile numbers
  *before* the regex check runs.
- `src/domains/auth/{password,queries,reset-tokens,notifications,actions}.ts`
  — password hashing wrapper; user CRUD (with a `MobileAlreadyRegisteredError`
  for a friendly duplicate message, backed by the real unique index, not
  just an app-level check); reset-token issue/verify/consume; a
  **clearly-labeled notification stub** that logs the password-reset link
  to the server console instead of pretending to send a real SMS, since
  no SMS/email provider is configured — same "don't fabricate a live
  integration" principle as the payment-provider rule, applied here too;
  and every Server Action (register/login/logout/forgot-password/reset-password).
- `src/domains/addresses/{queries,actions}.ts` — every query function
  takes `userId` and scopes by it; there is deliberately no
  `getAddressById(id)` without a `userId` parameter, so it's structurally
  hard for a future caller to skip the ownership check. Verified this
  session (see "Tests/checks") that a second user genuinely cannot read,
  update, or delete a first user's address by ID.
- `src/lib/auth/config.ts` + `next-auth.d.ts` — NextAuth config and the
  TypeScript module augmentation for `session.user.{id,mobile,role}`.

**New routes/pages:** `/register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`,
`/reset-password/[token]`, `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`, and a protected
`/account` layout (redirects to `/login` if not authenticated) with
`/account` (profile overview) and `/account/addresses` (list/add/edit/delete,
default-address exclusivity enforced in a DB transaction). All forms use
`useActionState` + a shared `FormField`/`SubmitButton` component pair
(rule "reusable components, don't duplicate large JSX").

**Header wiring — a deliberate architecture decision, not just
"connect the button":** The account icon in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
now links to `/account` or `/login` based on session state, read via
NextAuth's client-side `useSession()` (wrapped in
`src/components/auth/AuthSessionProvider.tsx`, added to the root layout)
— **not** by calling `auth()`/`cookies()` in `RootLayout` itself. That
would have forced `cookies()` to run on every request through the shared
root layout, which opts the *entire site* out of static rendering,
including the homepage Phase 2/4 verified as statically prerendered.
Verified this session: `npm run build` still shows `/` as `○ (Static)`
after this change. This is a presentation-only tradeoff (a brief
"logged out" flash before the client fetches `/api/auth/session`) — it
does not weaken any real security boundary, since every protected route
and every mutation independently calls `auth()` server-side. Full
reasoning is in `AuthSessionProvider.tsx`'s header comment.

**A real bug found and fixed during verification:** `createUser`/
`findUserByMobile` originally trusted that the mobile number passed in
was already normalized (true for the Server Action call path, which
goes through `registerSchema`'s `mobileSchema` first) — but a smoke test
calling `createUser` directly with an un-normalized number
(`"09121234567"` vs. the already-registered `"+989121234567"`) created a
second row for the same real phone number, defeating the unique
constraint's purpose. Fixed by normalizing defensively *inside* the
domain layer too (`normalizeOrThrow` in `src/domains/auth/queries.ts`),
not just at the validation layer — the domain layer is documented as
"the actual boundary" and shouldn't assume every future caller (a script,
an admin tool, Phase 11) remembers to pre-normalize. Re-verified after
the fix: duplicate correctly rejected regardless of input format.

**Tests/checks — all run against a real local PostgreSQL 16 instance and
a real `next build` + `next start` production server, not just `next
dev`:**
- `npm run typecheck` — clean. (One real issue caught and fixed along
  the way: augmenting `next-auth/jwt`'s `JWT` interface silently didn't
  work, because that module is a pure `export * from "@auth/core/jwt"`
  re-export — TypeScript declaration merging doesn't reach through a
  re-export. Fixed by augmenting `@auth/core/jwt` directly instead,
  which is where the interface NextAuth's callbacks actually use is
  declared.)
- `npm run lint` — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean; `/` and other content pages remain `○
  (Static)`; `/account`, `/account/addresses`, `/login`, `/register`,
  `/reset-password/[token]`, and the NextAuth route are correctly `ƒ
  (Dynamic)`.
- Manual end-to-end HTTP verification against `npm run start` (with
  `trustHost: true` added to `src/lib/auth/config.ts` after the first
  attempt hit NextAuth's `UntrustedHost` error under `next start` —
  documented in-file why this is safe: it doesn't affect
  `AUTH_SECRET`-based cookie signing, the actual security boundary):
  - Wrong password → HTTP 302, **no** session cookie set.
  - Correct password → HTTP 302, `authjs.session-token` set as
    `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` (confirmed via `curl -v`, not just assumed
    from a 200 response).
  - `/api/auth/session` with the cookie → correct `id`/`mobile`/`role`
    payload.
  - `/account` with the cookie → HTTP 200, page content (name, email)
    genuinely reflects the logged-in user's DB row.
  - `/account` without the cookie → HTTP 307 to `/login`.
  - `/api/auth/signout` → session cleared; `/api/auth/session` afterward
    returns `null`; `/account` afterward redirects again.
  - Duplicate-mobile registration rejected (after the fix above), in
    both already-normalized and raw-input forms.
  - Password-reset token lifecycle: issue → verify (valid) → consume →
    verify again (correctly `null`, single-use enforced) → a bogus token
    also correctly returns `null`.
  - Cross-user address ownership: a second user's attempts to read,
    update, or delete a first user's address by ID all correctly no-op
    (return `null`/`false`), the address is unmodified, and the owner
    can still delete their own address normally. Default-address
    exclusivity (only one `isDefault: true` row per user) verified via a
    second default-address insert correctly unsetting the first.
  - All smoke-test rows deleted afterward — the database is back to its
    seeded-catalog-only state.

**Known limitations / follow-ups (not blocking, documented rather than
silently ignored):**
- Password reset "sends" via `console.log` only (`src/domains/auth/notifications.ts`)
  — no real SMS/email provider is configured (`SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY` is
  blank in `.env.example`). Swap that one function's body once a real
  provider is chosen; no call-site changes needed elsewhere.
- The Header's logged-in/out state can lag by one client-side session
  refetch immediately after login/logout, since `redirect()` inside a
  Server Action is a client-side route transition, not a hard reload,
  and NextAuth's `SessionProvider` doesn't automatically revalidate on
  every Next.js navigation. Cosmetic only (a stale icon for a moment);
  not a security issue since every real check is server-side. A future
  session could tighten this with `router.refresh()` after
  login/logout or `useSession()`'s `update()`.
- `role` exists on `users` and flows through the session, but nothing
  reads/enforces it yet — that's Phase 11 (admin).
- Registration signs the user in immediately with no email/mobile
  verification step (`mobileVerified` stays `false` forever right now).
  This was a documented assumption (rule A.18): no real OTP/SMS provider
  exists yet to verify against, and blocking registration on a
  verification step that can't actually happen yet would just break
  the flow. Revisit once Phase 6+/12's real SMS provider exists.
- No rate limiting on login/register/forgot-password yet — that's
  explicitly Phase 13's job ("rate limiting for sensitive/public
  abuse-prone endpoints"), not silently forgotten.
- `AUTH_SECRET` in this sandbox's `.env.local` is a placeholder dev
  value, not a real secret — same "sandbox-local, not a deliverable"
  caveat as Phase 3's `.env.local`. Generate a real one
  (`openssl rand -base64 32`) per environment.

## Architecture Decisions

(Cumulative — Phase 6 additions only; see git history for Phases 0-5.)

- Auth = NextAuth v5, Credentials + JWT, no adapter. See Phase 6
  write-up above and `src/lib/auth/config.ts`'s header comment for full
  reasoning.
- Session read for UI purposes (Header) happens client-side via
  `useSession()`, not server-side in the root layout, to preserve static
  rendering of content pages. Protected routes/mutations still use
  real, server-side `auth()` checks — this is a presentation-layer
  choice only.
- Mobile number, not email, is the canonical account identifier,
  normalized to `+98XXXXXXXXXX` at both the validation layer (Zod
  preprocessing) and the domain layer (defense in depth, see the bug
  fix above) — never trust a single layer to have normalized correctly.
- `role` is a Postgres enum on `users`, not a boolean, per
  TRENDS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §7 — unused until Phase 11 but the schema
  cost of adding it now vs. migrating later favored doing it now.
- Password reset tokens are single-use, short-lived (30 min), and only
  their hash is ever persisted — mirrors the `passwordHash` principle.

## Important Assumptions

- Password-based auth (mobile + password) was chosen as this phase's
  primary mechanism, not OTP/passwordless, since no SMS provider exists
  to send OTPs with yet (rule A.17/A.18). The architecture doesn't
  preclude adding OTP later (`mobileVerified` and the notification
  adapter boundary already exist for it).
- New accounts default to `role: "customer"` and are immediately signed
  in on registration, with no email/mobile verification gate — see
  "Known limitations" above.
- `.env.local`'s `AUTH_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL` are sandbox-local dev
  values, not production secrets.

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

(Cumulative — see Phase 5's write-up for pre-existing items: `ILIKE`
search vs. full-text, category OG images, `Product` JSON-LD currency
code. Phase 6 adds:)

- Notification "sending" is a console-log stub (see above).
- No rate limiting yet on auth endpoints (Phase 13).
- Header session state can lag briefly after login/logout (see above).
- `mobileVerified` is schema-only, never set `true` (no OTP provider
  yet).

## Next Session Instructions

- **Exact next objective: PHASE 7 — Wishlist + cart**, per
  CLAUDE_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt §D. Phase 6 is verified COMPLETE — do
  not redo auth/account work; build cart/wishlist on top of it.
  1. Read CLAUDE_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt's Phase 7 task list and
     TRENDS_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §6 "Cart"/"Wishlist" before writing code.
  2. Real auth now exists (`getCurrentUser()` in
     `src/domains/auth/actions.ts`, `auth()` in `src/lib/auth/config.ts`)
     — use it for the authenticated half of cart/wishlist. Guest cart
     (no account) still needs its own storage strategy (a signed cookie
     holding a cart ID is the usual pattern) since Phase 7 explicitly
     requires guest carts and a guest→user merge on login.
  3. Replace `src/domains/cart/demo-data.ts` (currently hardcoded, used
     by the cart drawer and Header's cart-count badge) with real cart
     domain logic — schema (`carts`, `cart_items`), server-authoritative
     price/stock validation against `product_variants` (never trust a
     client-submitted price), quantity controls, empty states.
  4. New wishlist tables/actions/UI, persisted for logged-in users
     (reuse the `users`/ownership-scoped-query pattern from
     `src/domains/addresses/queries.ts` — every wishlist query should
     take `userId` and scope by it the same way).
  5. Guest-to-user cart merge on login: the natural place to hook this
     in is `loginAction`/`registerAction` in `src/domains/auth/actions.ts`
     right after a successful `signIn()`, before the `redirect()`.
  6. Run `typecheck`/`lint`/`build` and manually verify: add to cart as
     guest → log in → guest cart merges into account cart (not lost, not
     duplicated) → wishlist persists across sessions → stock/price shown
     is genuinely read from `product_variants`, not stale/hardcoded.
  7. Update `PROGRESS.md` the same way this session did.
- Files/areas to inspect first: `src/domains/cart/demo-data.ts` and
  `src/components/overlays/CartDrawer.tsx` (what's being replaced),
  `src/domains/addresses/queries.ts` (the ownership-scoping pattern to
  reuse for wishlist), `src/lib/db/schema/product-variants.ts` (what
  cart/wishlist items actually reference — variant, not product, since
  variants carry price/stock).
- Do not start Phase 8 (checkout) before Phase 7 — checkout needs a real
  cart to check out.
